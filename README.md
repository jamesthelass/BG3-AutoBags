Tired of spending hours in camp arranging matches, Sebastian? Can't catch up to your loot goblin alter ego? Try AutoBags!

## What's In The Bag??!!??

15 new bags to automatically sort and store the items you organize the most. One of each is deposited into your camp chest and is accessible at any point in a playthrough.

- <ins>**Alchemical Coating Chest**</ins> - Poisons, Oils, and other weapon coatings
- <ins>**Armor Chest**</ins> - All armor types, regardless of weight or intended body part
- <ins>**Camp Clothes Chest**</ins> - All camp clothes
- <ins>**Crate of Dyes**</ins> - All dyes
- <ins>**Grenade Chest**</ins> - Throwable items, includes grenades and more (grease bottles and the like)
- <ins>**Instrument Chest**</ins> - Special and unique instruments only
- <ins>**Jewelry Box**</ins> - Equippable rings and amulets
- <ins>**Keepsakes Chest**</ins> - Items that serve only sentimental purposes
- <ins>**Potion Belt**</ins> - All potions and elixirs
- <ins>**Quest Chest**</ins> - Quest items 
- <ins>**Ammunition Quiver**</ins> - Arrows
- <ins>**Scroll Case**</ins> - Magic scrolls
- <ins>**Travel Bookshelf**</ins> - Books but not scrolls
- <ins>**Weapons Crate**</ins> - All weapons regardless of type, damage type, handedness, etc.
- <ins>**Wares Chest**</ins> - All items custom tagged as Valuable that aren't also tagged as a keepsake, quest item, equippable jewelry, instrument, or dye. 

==================================================================
## How Does It Work?

<ins>Adds 27 tags to the Tag Editor table to apply to Root Templates for various overrides.</ins> Some tags are included for future releases and are not currently used.

<ins>187 Items have Root Template Overrides to apply custom tags.</ins> The tags cascade down to any other items that rely on them as parent templates, e.g. BASE_LOOT_ARMOR being tagged as JTL_AB_ARMOR means that all armor pieces will inherit the JTL_AB_ARMOR tag without having to be overridden individually. Unfortunately, not all the items in BG3 are so cleanly defined, so there are still some items which must be individually tagged.

Details on the items tagged are in [my other repository](https://github.com/jamesthelass/BG3-Mod-Info).

==================================================================
## Installation

<ins>**To Install**</ins>: Import the .pak file with [BG3 Mod Manager](https://github.com/LaughingLeader/BG3ModManager) by LaughingLeader

<ins>**To Uninstall**</ins>: This mod may be difficult to remove once it is used in a campaign. For all intents and purposes, consider this mod required for any campaign it is used in. Make a test save to be sure it's what you want to use! If you really want to remove it, make extra sure that all items are out of the bags before removing the mod. I can't guarantee items won't be lost, so be extra diligent.
